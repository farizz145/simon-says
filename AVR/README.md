AVR Simon Says
=================

Implementation of the classic ‘Simon Says’ game using the AVR microcontroller.

Usage
=====
* Build the circuit using the [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) schematic. A breadboard implementation might look something like [this](https://github.com/leonsodhi/Simon-Says/blob/master/AVR/breadboard.jpg)
* Build the project - I used Atmel Studio 6
* Read the source to see how it works :-)
